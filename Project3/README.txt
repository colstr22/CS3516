To compile and run the code, use the "make" 
command on the command line, and type ./project3
to run the simulation. There is a slight problem
in that the program will not terminate, because 
nodes are unable to reach a terminal state where
the updates are not making any changes. 
Segmentation fault will also occur some times.
Please recompile and run it again if this occurs.
You will be asked to enter a trace. any value 
above two will output all of the simulation 
information, whereas 1 will only get some of it
and zero gives the bare basics.
